## Introduction

Our Vue starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Vue frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Vue applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Vue combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Vue starter kit utilizes Vue 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com) component library.

## Enhanced Features

This kit extends the official Laravel Vue starter with additional development tools and quality assurance:

- **PHPStan (Maximum Level)**: Static analysis at the highest level for robust type checking
- **Laravel Pint**: Automated styling with opinionated rules approved by Nuno Maduro
- **Rector**: Automated PHP refactoring and upgrades
- **Testing Suite**: 
  - Pest PHP for elegant testing
  - Architecture tests for maintaining code structure
- **IDE Helper**: Enhanced IDE support for Laravel facades and models

> This starter kit is regularly synchronized with the official Laravel Vue starter kit to ensure you get the latest features and security updates.

## Installation

Installation can be done by laravel installer.
